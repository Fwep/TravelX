TravelX is a travel planner with an emphasis on a simple, flat-design user experience.

## Background and Overview
The typical consumer experience of planning a trip often consists of a convoluted web of flight itineraries, hotel bookings and disjointed travel tours. We intend to simplify the experience by providing a simple, seamless solution: we generate curated vacation plans to any popular destination.

This problem can be decomposed into three parts:
- The use of a travel API that constitutes the dataset from which our application will draw the majority of our data with - respect to travel destinations
- A search feature allowing users to input a travel location and get unique multi-day itineraries each time
- An algorithm that provides tailored results based on a particular userâ€™s preference to any one ticket.
